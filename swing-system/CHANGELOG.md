## 2026-11-02 (automatic)
- Weekly session summary:
  - Sandbox tests: 27 passed in 0.58s
  - Live v1 re-validated: gate FAILED
  - Paper check for v1: {'closed': 0} - fewer than 20 closed trades, too early to judge (no action).

  - Claude review: 0 reviewed trades closed - too few to judge; it remains an explainer only.
